# 3.2 Collaborative operation mode

ISO 10218-1 and ISO/TS 15066 describe four operating modes so that operators can practice work safety without being exposed to risks. The collaborative operation should meet a least one of these requirements, and a visual display should show that the system is in collaborative operation when it is in operation.
