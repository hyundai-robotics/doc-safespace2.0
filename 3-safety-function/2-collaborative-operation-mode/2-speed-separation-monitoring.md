# 3.2.2 Speed and separation monitoring

The robot operates within a specified distance and speed.

In the speed and separation monitoring mode, the driving speed of the robot is controlled in proportion to the distance and the relative speed between the robot and the operator, utilizing sensors that can detect the operator’s position and speed. You can use the deceleration mode for the inputs of the external sensors that detect distance.

The reference information on the use of the speed and separation monitoring mode is as follows:

* For more details on the setting of deceleration mode, see “[**3.3.1.5 Re plan**](../3-safety-function/1-robot-safety-condition/5-re-plan.md)”
* For more details on the setting of safety I/O signals, see “[**3.3.3 Safety I/O signals**](../3-safety-function/3-safety-io/README.md)”를 참조하십시오.
