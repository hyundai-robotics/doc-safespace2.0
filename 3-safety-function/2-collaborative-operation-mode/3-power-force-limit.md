# 3.2.3 Power and force limiting

This limits the impact on the human body in case of a collision. The collision detection function and power, momentum limiting function can limit the impact on the operator in case of a collision between the operator and the robot.

The collision detection function detects collisions according to the set sensitivity (%). You can also restrict the robot’s driving power by setting the electric power (W) and momentum (kg·m/s).

For more details on the setting of the robot’s safety functions, see “[**3.3 Safety functions**](../3-safety-function/README.md)”
