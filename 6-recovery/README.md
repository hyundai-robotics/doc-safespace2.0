# 6. Recovery

 In manual mode, you can clear errors that occur because of the safety function violations during monitoring. Because position detection is disabled in manual mode, you can drive the robot and adjust its angle and position without violating the safety functions.


{% hint style="warning" %}
**\[Caution]**: After clearing the violation, recheck the safety layout setting and the teaching position of the operating program.
{% endhint %}
