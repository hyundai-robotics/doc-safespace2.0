# 1.6 Reaction time


*   **Stopping Reaction time**

    When a Safety function violation is triggered, the reaction time until a stop is 9.8 ms. The response time should be taken into account when calculating the robot's stopping time and stopping distance."

*   **PROFIsafe Reaction time**
	
	When an external stop is triggered via PROFIsafe, the reaction time until a stop is 40.8 ms. To obtain the time until the robot completely stop, the communication cycle, as well as the calculated values for the robot's stopping time and stopping distance, need to be added.
